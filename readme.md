# Yet Another Task Manager

## What
### Requirements
The CLI should be a simple way of managing a list of tasks/todos.

* It must be able to compile on both Linux and macOS using CMake.
* You can use all of the features from C++17 and below.
* The tasks should be persisted on disk between execution of the CLI application. Binary, plaintext, encrypted, ... -- that's up to you.
* Single user -- no login required.

### Functionality
As a user, you should be able to:

* Add a task.
* Edit a task.
* List tasks.
* Search for a task.
* Mark a task as completed.

## Why
It's an interview process assignment.
